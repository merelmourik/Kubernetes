# Kubernetes infrastructure
In this project I've setup an infrastructure of different services using Kubernetes. I've set up a multi-server cluster with each server running in its own container. The image below shows the infrastructure.

To start just run the setup.sh file. When this is done, you can run 'minikube dashboard' on the commandline to go to the dasboard which gives an overview of the running pods.
